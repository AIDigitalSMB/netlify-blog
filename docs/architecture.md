# Architecture

How the site is put together, and why the awkward parts are the way they are.

## Stack

| Piece | Choice | Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Framework | Astro, static output, zero client JS by default | 7.2.8 |
| Language | TypeScript, `strict` | 6.x |
| Content | Astro content collections + Zod schema | — |
| CMS | Sveltia CMS from the unpkg CDN, GitHub backend, PAT login | latest (verified 0.201.1) |
| Search | Pagefind, run as an npm `postbuild` step | 1.5.2 |
| Comments | Giscus (GitHub Discussions) | — |
| Feed | `@astrojs/rss` | 4.x |
| Sitemap | `@astrojs/sitemap` | 3.x |
| Styling | Hand-written CSS with custom properties | — |
| Hosting | Netlify, deployed by its dashboard Git integration | — |

Three runtime dependencies, three dev dependencies. No CSS framework — the whole
stylesheet is one file and nothing is shipped that isn't used.

`src/consts.ts` is the single edit point for titles, author details, page size, Giscus
IDs, the contact endpoint and social links.

## Routes

| Route | File | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | `pages/index.astro` | Hero, featured post, latest grid, categories, author blurb |
| `/blog/`, `/blog/2/` … | `pages/blog/[...page].astro` | `paginate()`, 6 per page |
| `/blog/<slug>/` | `pages/blog/[slug].astro` | `slug` is the collection entry `id` |
| `/category/<slug>/`, `…/2/` | `pages/category/[category]/[...page].astro` | |
| `/tag/<slug>/`, `…/2/` | `pages/tag/[tag]/[...page].astro` | |
| `/about/`, `/contact/`, `/search/` | `pages/<name>/[...slug].astro` | **Flag-gated** — see below |
| `/404` | `pages/404.astro` | |
| `/rss.xml` | `pages/rss.xml.ts` | |
| `/sitemap-index.xml` | `@astrojs/sitemap` | `/search/` filtered out — it is `noindex` |

`[slug].astro` and `[...page].astro` share the `blog/` directory. Astro resolves named
dynamic routes ahead of rest parameters, and in a static build every path is enumerated
up front, so the two cannot silently collide.

Post URLs read `https://aidigitalsmb.netlify.app/blog/<slug>/` — the site root
plus the collection's route. Netlify sites don't have GitHub's user-site-vs-project-site
split at all, so there's no `/blog/blog/<slug>/`-style doubling risk to design around
here — this project is root-served, just like a GitHub Pages *user* site would be, but
for a different reason.

## Optional pages

`/about/`, `/contact/` and `/search/` are gated by `FEATURES` in `src/consts.ts`:

```ts
export const FEATURES = { about: false, search: false, contact: false };
```

Each lives at `pages/<name>/[...slug].astro` with a `getStaticPaths` that returns `[]`
when its flag is off, so the page is **not generated at all** and the URL 404s. Merely
dropping the nav link would leave the page live, shareable and indexable — this does
not.

Every link to them is conditional too: header nav, footer, the home page's hero button
and author-section link, the 404 page's search button, and the About page's contact
sentence. Turning a flag back on restores the page and all of its links with no other
change.

Note the About page carries `data-pagefind-body`, so with it hidden the search index
covers posts only.

## Base paths

This is the part that breaks sites, so it gets an explicit design rather than a
convention.

This is a **Netlify site, root-served**, so `base` is `/`. Netlify has no GitHub-style
user-site-vs-project-site distinction at all — there's no dashboard setting or
repo-naming convention that changes this. A root-absolute `/foo/` link therefore happens
to work — but that is a property of the current hosting, not of the code. **Every
internal link, asset reference and absolute URL still goes through
[`src/lib/url.ts`](../src/lib/url.ts)**, which exposes three functions:

| Function | Use for | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `withBase(p)` | Paths *you* author | `/about/` → `/about/` here; `/blog/about/` under a base |
| `absFromBuiltPath(p, site)` | Paths *Astro* produced — they already carry the base | `Astro.url.pathname`, `ImageMetadata.src`, `paginate()` URLs |
| `absUrl(p, site)` | Full absolute URL from a path you author | canonical, Open Graph, RSS, JSON-LD |

That discipline is carried over from a lesson learned on an earlier version of this
template: moving a site from a project site (`<user>.github.io/blog/`, `base: '/blog/'`)
to a user site was meant to be a config change and nothing else, but paths that had been
hardcoded turned the move into a hunt through every template. Nothing here has needed to
move, but the same two functions mean a future move to a sub-path or a custom domain
stays a config change and nothing else.

There are deliberately two absolute-URL functions instead of one clever one. An earlier
version of this template tried to detect "does this path already start with the
base?" and got it wrong precisely because, under a `/blog/` base, a `/blog/` route made
`/blog/my-post/` ambiguous. Two shipped bugs came from that guess — pagination emitting
`/blog/blog/blog/2/`, and post canonicals dropping a segment. Naming the two cases
removes the ambiguity, and keeps working at any base.

**`paginate()` URLs already include the base.** Passing them through `withBase()` doubles
it. `Pagination.astro` takes them raw.

To re-check after any change, build and confirm this prints nothing:

```bash
npm run build
grep -rhoE 'https?://[^"< ]+' dist --include=*.html | grep -v 'aidigitalsmb.netlify.app' | sort -u
```

That's the full audit — every internal link, `srcset` entry and in-page anchor resolved
against the built output. It needs nothing beyond a local build to run, so there is no
reason to wait for a deploy to check it.

## Content pipeline

`content.config.ts` uses the glob loader over `src/content/blog` and types
`featured_image` as `z.union([image(), z.string().url()])` — an upload or a remote URL.
The entry `id` is derived from the filename and becomes the URL slug.

Draft filtering happens once, in `getPosts()`:

```ts
getCollection('blog', ({ data }) => (import.meta.env.PROD ? data.draft !== true : true))
```

`import.meta.env.PROD` is true during `astro build` and false under `astro dev`. Every
route and the feed call `getPosts()`, so nothing has to remember to filter.

## Images

`image()` resolves paths **relative to the Markdown file**, which is why frontmatter
stores `../../assets/images/uploads/…` rather than a tidy absolute path.

The CMS is configured to produce exactly that. In `public/admin/config.yml` the blog
collection sets **both**:

```yaml
media_folder: ../../assets/images/uploads
public_folder: ../../assets/images/uploads
```

Collection-level relative paths in Sveltia are resolved against the collection's
`folder` (`src/content/blog`), so uploads land in `src/assets/images/uploads/` and the
*same* relative string is written into the frontmatter. `media_folder` decides where the
file goes; `public_folder` decides what gets written into the post.

If posts ever move, both values move with them.

`featured_image` is typed `z.union([image(), z.string().url()])`, so a post may use an
upload *or* a remote URL. `src/components/FeaturedImage.astro` is the single place that
knows the difference: remote sources get `inferSize` so Astro fetches them at build time
for their dimensions, and `image.remotePatterns` authorises optimising them. The result
is that a pasted URL is downloaded, resized and re-served from this origin — including
in the `og:image` tag — so both routes end up optimised and neither costs the reader a
third-party request.

## Location maps

`map_embed` is an optional per-post field holding a Google Maps embed snippet. The
pasted HTML is never rendered: `src/lib/maps.ts` extracts the `src`, rejects anything
that is not an https URL, and `LocationMap.astro` builds a fresh iframe from it. That
keeps author-supplied markup out of the page and lets the site override Google's
hardcoded `600×450` with a frame that fills the column — 16:9 above 40rem, 4:3 below.

The wrapper carries a fixed `aspect-ratio`, so the lazily-loaded iframe reserves its
space and cannot shift the page when it arrives. This is the only third-party embed on
the site, and only on posts that opt into it.

## Search

Pagefind indexes the built HTML, so it runs as an npm `postbuild` script rather than an
Astro integration:

```json
"build": "astro build",
"postbuild": "pagefind --site dist"
```

Using the npm lifecycle hook matters: Netlify's build runs `npm run build`, so the index
is produced during that build and ships in the deployed artifact without any separate
build step to configure.

Only elements marked `data-pagefind-body` are indexed — the post `<article>` and the
About page — so navigation chrome does not pollute results.

One base-path wrinkle: Pagefind indexes `dist/`, which *is* the deploy root, so its
result URLs start at `/`. `src/pages/search.astro` passes `bundlePath` and a
`processResult` hook that puts the base back on the front.

Search cannot work under `npm run dev` — there is no index. The page detects the missing
bundle and shows an explanatory note instead of failing silently.

## Theme

CSS custom properties, three states:

1. No `data-theme` attribute → `prefers-color-scheme` decides.
2. `data-theme="dark"` / `"light"` → explicit choice wins in both directions.
3. Choice persisted in `localStorage`.

The bootstrap script is inlined in `<head>` before any painted markup, so a stored
preference applies before first paint — no flash. Both it and the toggle are wrapped in
`try/catch` so a browser with storage blocked still renders correctly, it just does not
remember.

Shiki emits both light and dark code themes as CSS variables; `global.css` picks the
matching one so code blocks follow the toggle rather than the OS.

**Visual design.** Unlike the other AIDigitalSMB sibling blogs, which each have their
own visual language, this one uses a neo-brutalist treatment: thick borders that match the text colour rather than a hairline
grey, zero border-radius, hard offset shadows with no blur, and uppercase heavy-weight
nav/brand/buttons. The interaction language differs too — cards and buttons "shift" on
hover (`translate` + a matching hard shadow) instead of lifting with a soft
drop-shadow. All of it lives in the token block and a handful of component rules at the
top of `src/styles/global.css`; the component markup is the shared engine.

## Client JavaScript

The entire budget, in inline scripts with nothing hydrated:

| Script | Where | Size |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Theme bootstrap | every page, in `<head>` | ~10 lines |
| Theme toggle | every page | ~15 lines |
| Copy-link button | post pages | ~20 lines |
| Pagefind UI loader | `/search/` only | ~30 lines |
| Giscus | post pages, `loading="lazy"` | third-party, deferred |

No framework runtime, no analytics, no web fonts, no cookie banner.

## SEO

`BaseHead.astro` emits a unique title and description, a base-aware canonical, Open
Graph and Twitter card tags, and — on post pages only — JSON-LD `BlogPosting`. Paginated
pages past the first are `noindex, follow`.

`robots.txt` sits at the domain root and is therefore **authoritative** — this is a
root-served site, so crawlers read it directly.

## Accessibility

Semantic landmarks, a skip link, visible focus rings, labelled navigation, `aria-current`
on the active nav item, real alt text (decorative images take `alt=""`), a
`prefers-reduced-motion` block, and `role="status"` for the copy-link confirmation.
Wide tables scroll inside themselves rather than pushing the page sideways.
