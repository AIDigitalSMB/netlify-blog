# Security

This is a public repository hosting a static blog. There is no server, no database and
no user data — which removes most of the usual attack surface and concentrates the rest
in one place: **repository write access**.

## Threat model in one paragraph

The published site is static HTML on Netlify. Nothing is computed per request and no
visitor input is stored. There are two independent ways to change what visitors see: a
commit to this GitHub repository (which Netlify's dashboard Git integration picks up
and rebuilds automatically), or a change made directly in the Netlify dashboard — build
settings, environment variables, custom domains, or rolling back to an older deploy —
none of which touches git at all. So the security of the blog is the security of
*both* — the GitHub account/tokens that can write to the repo, and whoever has access
to the Netlify team/site that builds and serves it.

## The CMS token

Sveltia CMS at `/admin` authenticates with a GitHub **fine-grained Personal Access
Token** that you paste at sign-in. There is no OAuth backend, no serverless function and
no client secret anywhere in this repository — deliberately, because a client secret in
a static site is not a secret.

Two token types work, with different blast radius:

- **Fine-grained**, scoped to this repository only, **Contents: read and write**. The
  tighter option. It can only be issued by the account that *owns* the repository —
  collaborator access does not qualify.
- **Classic** with the `public_repo` scope. Works from any account with push access, but
  grants write to **every public repository that account can push to**, not just this
  one. Use it only when the fine-grained route is unavailable, and prefer `public_repo`
  over full `repo`.

Either way the token:

- does **not** need Pull requests access (`publish_mode: simple` commits to `main`);
- should have an expiry set;
- **carries write access to the whole repository, not just posts** — and every push to
  `main` is picked up and built by Netlify automatically, with no CI gate or review step
  in between.

Treat it like a password. Do not commit it, do not paste it into anything other than the
Sveltia sign-in prompt, and revoke it at
<https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens> the moment you suspect exposure.

The token is held in browser storage on the machine where you signed in. Signing out
from the CMS clears it. Revoking it on GitHub invalidates it everywhere.

## The Netlify side

There is no deploy token in this project — no `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, no GitHub Actions
secret, no Netlify CLI anywhere in the pipeline. Deploys happen because Netlify's
dashboard is connected directly to this GitHub repository through its own **GitHub App
installation**, granted read access when that connection is made in the dashboard
(**Site configuration → Build & deploy → Git**). That installation is what lets Netlify
see pushes to `main` and pull the code to build.

That gives two independent things to think about, separate from the CMS token above:

- **The GitHub App installation itself.** Anyone who can manage installed GitHub Apps on
  the `AIDigitalSMB` account can revoke or reconfigure what repositories
  Netlify's integration can see. That is a GitHub-side permission, not a Netlify one.
- **Netlify team/site access.** Separately, anyone who can log into the Netlify team can
  change build settings, environment variables, custom domains, or roll back to an
  older deploy — **without touching GitHub at all**, bypassing commit history, branch
  protection and code review entirely. There is no scoped token to rotate here; the
  control is simply who has access to the Netlify team, and that access should be kept
  as tight as the GitHub collaborator list below.

## No permission model

There are no CMS roles. Anyone who can push to this repository can publish, edit or
delete any post, and whatever they push is built and served automatically. Access
control is GitHub's collaborator list and nothing else. Keep that list short.

## Deletion is not erasure

Deleting a post through the CMS creates a commit that removes the file. **Every previous
version remains in git history and on GitHub, indefinitely and publicly.**

Anything genuinely sensitive that reaches a commit must be treated as disclosed.
Deleting it afterwards does not undo that — it has to be rotated, revoked or otherwise
invalidated. Purging history requires a force-push and coordination, and does not remove
data already fetched or cached by others.

Drafts are the exception worth knowing: `draft: true` posts are excluded from the built
site entirely, but their source **is** committed and is public in the repository. A
draft is unpublished, not private.

## What ships publicly

The deployed site contains only the built output. There are no analytics, no tracking
scripts, no web fonts, no cookie banner, and no third-party requests except:

- `unpkg.com` — the Sveltia CMS bundle, loaded only on `/admin`;
- `giscus.app` — the comment widget, loaded lazily on post pages once configured;
- `google.com` — only on posts that fill in the **Location map** field, and only when
  the reader scrolls far enough for the lazily-loaded iframe to fetch;
- whichever form service you configure for `/contact/`, on submit only.

Netlify itself sits in front of every request as the CDN/edge host — that is
infrastructure, not a third-party embed, but worth knowing: Netlify can see and log raw
traffic to this site the way any host can.

Comments are GitHub Discussions. Commenters are identified by their GitHub account and
their comments are public, hosted by GitHub, and governed by GitHub's own policies.

## Dependencies

Three runtime dependencies and three dev dependencies, all first-party Astro or Pagefind
packages. Keep them current:

```bash
npm outdated
npm audit
```

The Sveltia CMS bundle is loaded from a CDN at the unpinned `latest` URL, so fixes
arrive without a redeploy — at the cost of a breaking upstream change being able to
affect `/admin` without a commit here. `public/admin/index.html` carries a commented
pinned alternative if you would rather trade one risk for the other.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a security problem, please **do not open a public issue**. Email the address
on the [contact page](https://aidigitalsmb.netlify.app/contact/)
with enough detail to reproduce it, and allow a reasonable window before disclosure.

This is a personal blog maintained by one person, not a funded project — there is no
bounty and response times are best-effort. Reports are still very welcome.
