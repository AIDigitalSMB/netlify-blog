# AIDigitalSMB

A static blog for a single author. Astro + TypeScript, Markdown content collections,
Sveltia CMS at `/admin`, Pagefind search, Giscus comments, deployed to Netlify by its
own dashboard Git integration.

**Target URL:** <https://aidigitalsmb.netlify.app/> — **not live yet.** This is the URL the
site will have once the repository is imported in the Netlify dashboard and the site is
named `aidigitalsmb` (see [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md#1-netlify-git-integration)).
Until then it is only a placeholder.

One of a family of sibling AIDigitalSMB blogs, one per static host — same engine, own
git history, own visual design. This one is the Netlify blog and uses a neo-brutalist
theme (thick borders, zero radius, hard offset shadows) — see the note at the top of
[`src/styles/global.css`](src/styles/global.css).

No server, no database, no tracking scripts, no cookie banner, no CSS framework. Three
runtime dependencies. The only client-side JavaScript is a theme toggle, a copy-link
button, the search page and the comment widget.

| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | How the site is built and why the awkward parts are that way |
| [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) | CI/CD, required Netlify configuration, verifying a deploy, rollback |
| [docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md) | Every failure hit while building this, with the fix |
| [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) | Threat model, token hygiene, why deletion is not erasure |

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm install` | Install dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server at http://localhost:4321/ — **drafts visible** |
| `npm run build` | Production build into `dist/`, then Pagefind indexes it (`postbuild`) |
| `npm run preview` | Serve `dist/` — the only faithful test of search, `/admin/` and base paths |
| `npm run check` | TypeScript + Astro diagnostics |

### Windows: Smart App Control

If a build fails with *"An Application Control policy has blocked this file"*, Windows
Smart App Control is refusing Astro's unsigned native compiler binary. Install the WASI
fallback:

```bash
npm install --no-save --force @astrojs/compiler-binding-wasm32-wasi
```

Re-run it after every `npm install` or `npm ci`. Netlify's build runners are unaffected.
Details in [troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md).

## Writing a post

Open [`/admin/`](https://aidigitalsmb.netlify.app/admin/) → **New Post** →
uncheck **Draft** → **Save**. That commits to `main`, which Netlify builds and deploys.

Or write the file directly — posts are Markdown in `src/content/blog/`, and the filename
is the URL slug:

```yaml
---
title: "Post title"
description: "One or two sentences, used for cards, meta description and social."
date: "2026-08-20T07:15:00.000Z"
author: "Your Name"
featured_image: "../../assets/images/uploads/something.jpg"
category: "Engineering"
tags: [astro, performance]
draft: false
---
```

Frontmatter is validated at build time — a typo fails the build instead of shipping
broken output, and a failed build leaves the previous version live.

`draft: true` posts render in `npm run dev` and are dropped entirely from production:
no page, no feed entry, no archive listing, no search hit. Full reference in
[writing.md](docs/writing.md).

## Base-path safety

This is a **root-served** site, so `base` is `/` and a root-absolute `/foo/` link
happens to work. That is a coincidence of the current hosting, not a licence to
hardcode paths: every internal link still goes through
[`src/lib/url.ts`](src/lib/url.ts) — `withBase()` for paths you author,
`absFromBuiltPath()` for paths Astro produced, `absUrl()` for absolute URLs.

Keeping that discipline is what lets the site move under a base path, or onto a custom
domain, as a config change rather than a rewrite.

To verify after any change, build and confirm every absolute URL points at this site:

```bash
grep -rhoE 'https?://[^"< ]+' dist --include=*.html --include=*.xml   | grep -v 'aidigitalsmb.netlify.app' | sort -u
```

## Status

Code, content structure and CMS are complete and build clean (`npm run check`, 0
errors). **Not yet deployed** — the Netlify side of the one-time setup (connecting the
dashboard's Git integration to this repository) has not been done yet. See
[docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for the exact steps.

To deploy, import the repo in the Netlify dashboard (**Add new site → Import an existing
project → Deploy with GitHub**). Build command `npm run build`, publish directory
`dist`, Node 22 — all of which Netlify reads from the committed
[`netlify.toml`](netlify.toml), so nothing needs typing into the build form.

> **Gotcha — "Make public".** Netlify's dashboard may prompt you to **Make public** the
> deploy. The GitHub repository is already public, so that prompt is not about the code;
> it concerns whether the deployed site is reachable by visitors. Read what the prompt
> says before clicking, and accept it only if you want the site publicly reachable at
> its `netlify.app` address. Until a public deploy exists, the target URL above will
> not serve this project.

Outstanding setup — none of it blocking, all of it in
[docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md): the Netlify Git integration, the CMS token, Giscus IDs,
contact form endpoint and author details are still unset. The site works without them;
comments and the contact form show a short notice instead.
